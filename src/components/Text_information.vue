            In this tutorial we're going to build a component we can use to display the weather of a location in VueJS. This component will be created with a location search textbox, this will then search a free weather API to get the information for the location based search. First lets create the HTML with the weather component, then the JavaScript files of Vue and Vue-resource. Vue-resource is the Vue library used to make HTTP requests. The final JavaScript file is the app.js which is what we'll use for the weather component.
